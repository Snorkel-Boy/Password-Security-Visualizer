Intelligence Lab | Password Security Simulator
A modern, high-fidelity password strength analyzer built for the 2025 security landscape. This laboratory moves beyond simple character counting to evaluate passwords using Shannon Entropy, Neural Predictability, and Grover’s Quantum Search logic.

🔬 Core Intelligence Metrics
The application tracks four primary vectors to determine a password's "True Security":

Bit Score (Shannon Entropy): The mathematical measure of randomness. A score of 128 bits is the gold standard, matching AES-128 encryption.

AI Guessability: Simulates an attacker using a Large Language Model (LLM) or PassGAN. It detects "human-like" patterns that AI is trained to exploit.

Character Pool (N): Real-time tracking of the available character set. It calculates how your choice of symbols exponentially increases the search space.

2025 Crack Time: Benchmarked against a professional-grade cluster of 12x NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPUs—the standard for high-level brute-force testing this year.

🚀 Getting Started
Installation
No installation or server-side environment is required. The project is a "Portable Web App" (PWA) contained in a single file.

Download or copy the intelligence-lab.html file.

Open it in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge).

Technical Stack
Frontend: Vanilla HTML5, CSS3 (Modern Minimalist/Claude-inspired).

Analysis Engine: zxcvbn via CDN.

Mathematical Logic: Custom JavaScript implementations for Shannon Entropy and Quantum search space estimation.

🛡️ Security Principles
This lab is designed to teach users the 2025 Security Paradigm:

Length beats Complexity: A 20-character simple phrase is statistically superior to an 8-character complex jumble.

Unpredictability is Key: AI can guess "P@ssw0rd!" in milliseconds because the substitution logic is a known pattern.

Future Proofing: By evaluating the "Quantum Search Space," users can prepare for the "Harvest Now, Decrypt Later" threat.

Disclaimer: This tool is for educational purposes. While the math is accurate based on current 2025 benchmarks, no password is 100% unhackable. Always enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
